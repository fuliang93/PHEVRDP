Here are the codes for PHEVRDP with continuous speed variables. 

c_io.py : the Iterated Optimization Heuristic for the instances with recharging stations;

c_bc.py: the branch-and-cut for the instances with recharging stations;

nc_io.py: the Iterated Optimization Heuristic for the instances without a recharging station;

nc_bc.py: the branch-and-cut for the instances without a recharging station;

para_cha_solomon.py: parameters for the instances with recharging stations;

para_solomon.py: parameters for the instances without recharging stations.

The codes for PHEVRDP with discrete speed variables can be easily derived from these.
